Title: VietHarmony: Borda-Based Ensemble with Ontology-Driven Insights for Vietnamese Traditional Music Exploration
Abstract: This study centers on Vietnamese traditional music genres, including _Ca Tru_, _Don Ca Tai Tu_, and _Cheo_, which represent invaluable cultural heritage increasingly at risk of erosion as interest among younger audiences diminishes. To counteract this critical threat, we propose VietHarmony, an innovative AI-powered framework designed to rejuvenate and protect these rich musical traditions. VietHarmony leverages a fusion of machine learning models, utilizing Borda voting to amalgamate the outputs of diverse CNN architectures. By integrating DenseNet169, MobileNet, and ResNet-50 models in a coordinated manner, this ensemble achieves a remarkable accuracy (F1-score) of approximately $98.43\%$. Central to this approach is our novel algorithm, _FAMBO_ (**F**usion of **A**udio classification **M**odels using **BO**rda), which enhances the precision and stability of genre classification. Additionally, we introduce a $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ lightweight ontology that effectively extracts and presents comprehensive, contextual information about these musical forms. Delivered through an intuitive web-based platform, this holistic framework offers a pioneering solution for the preservation and revitalization of Vietnam's intangible cultural heritage, ensuring that these esteemed musical traditions continue to thrive for future generations.
